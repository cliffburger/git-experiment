Here is how our branch off of a branch worked:

1: create a branch "branch-in-testing-from-which-we-need-stuff"
2: modify master
3: We want a branch off of the first branch, so create a branch off of "branch-in-testing-from-which-we-need-stuff" called "a-new-branch-off-of-f1e2f64"
4: modify "branch-in-testing-from-which-we-need-stuff" to represent bug fixes
