Here is how our branch off of a branch worked:

1: create a branch "branch-in-testing-from-which-we-need-stuff"
2: modify master
3: We want a branch off of the first branch, so create a branch off of "branch-in-testing-from-which-we-need-stuff" called "a-new-branch-off-of-f1e2f64"
4: modify "branch-in-testing-from-which-we-need-stuff" to represent bug fixes

Step 5: Merge master into the new branch
git checkout a-new-branch-off-of-f1e2f64
git merge master

*   b6648e3 - (52 seconds ago) Merge branch 'master' into a-new-branch-off-of-f1e2f64  Cliff Burger (HEAD, a-new-branch-

============================
Step 6: Merge "branch-in-testing-from-which-we-need-stuff" into master (pull before the dependent branch pulls) 
In master: git merge branch-in-testing-from-which-we-need-stuff
